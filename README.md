Game description:
You are an adventurer. Now you are going to find treasures in the dungeon. Each treasure gives points between 1 and 3. There are also traps and monsters in the dungeon, which decrease your life by between 0 and 1. You start this adventure with 3 lives. As an adventurer, you have only two choices: continue or quit. If you choose to quit, this adventure ends, and your score is calculated. If your lives become 0, then the adventure ends, and you lose all your score.
